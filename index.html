                Emma Creasey creates intimate and curious paintings that imbue the mundane with a sense of opulence. Exploring the possibilities in visual story-telling, much of Emmas work focuses on the intimacy of sharing food. While each painting has a narrative of its own, Emmas works are linked through their tendency to leave the viewer feeling as though they have stumbled upon a private moment.

                From abundant feasts abandoned in a forest clearing, to bright interiors that tread the boundary between comforting and somehow sinister, Emma's paintings dance between the weird and the familiar. By concocting a distinct mood through a mixture of food, homes and bodies, her scenes are charged with a narrative surrealism that's not often seen.
